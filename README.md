# MkDocs CloudCannon Demo Site

A barebones MkDocs site using the [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

## CloudCannon Configuration File

To configure the CMS, a `cloudcannon.config.yml` file has been created at the root of the repository. This contains the following sections:

### Collections

In `collections_config.docs` we specify a `docs` collection. This will be shown in the CloudCannon sidebar and will allow editors to make changes within this collection.

To match MkDocs' default URL behavior, we use the `[full_slug]` url placeholder.

These URLs are used in the CloudCannon interface for opening previews and generating screenshots.

### Paths

In `paths` we specify the path `docs` for both our `uploads` and `static` directories. This ensures that assets uploaded in CloudCannon will be placed inside the `docs` directory, and will be linked relative to the same directory.

| editor's file | uploaded file  | output url |
|---------------|----------------|------------|
| image.png     | docs/image.png | /image.png |

### Editables

In `_editables.content` we specify the toolbar options that editors will see in the [CloudCannon Content Editor](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/introducing-the-content-editor/).

## Connecting the Site to CloudCannon

*   When connecting this repository to CloudCannon, choose the `Other` option for your static site generator. When prompted for **Command Line Options**, use the following values:

    | field           | value                       |
    |-----------------|-----------------------------|
    | Install Command | pip install mkdocs-material |
    | Build Command   | mkdocs build                |
    | Output Path     | site                        |

    > `mkdocs` is already installed on the CloudCannon build image, so the install command is only needed for our theme. If you removed `theme: material` from `mkdocs.yml`, you could leave the install field blank.

    > `site` is the default directory that `mkdocs build` will use for its output.

*   Additionally, check `Use the beta version of @cloudcannon/reader`. This provides the `[full_slug]` placeholder that we use in our `cloudcannon.config.yml`.

## Done!

That's all â€” once your site builds you will be able to browse, edit, and add to the `docs` collection in CloudCannon.
